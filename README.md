# Astar

Created a simple Astar pathfinding interface.

In the documentation folder you can find:
* A class diagram


This project is divided in 3 parts:
* core: Where all the components are for the Astar Algorithm.
* examples: Where all the examples are. examples depends on the core package.
* tests: Where all the tests are. tests depends on the core package.
---

Necessary packages for the Astar Algorithm (The algorithm as written in the code):
* core.Interfaces
* core.FunctionalTesting
* core.Node
* core.Grid
* core.PathFinding
* core.CustomExceptions

Necessary packages for the Astar Algorithm (Light version):
* core.Interfaces 
* core.CustomExceptions
* \+ The ones that you want prewritten.


**core.Plot is only used to show the user how the path looks like**
